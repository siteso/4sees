    My experience over the past two decades working with teens and their families has taught me how critical
    relationships are to building resilience and success in life.
    It has taught me how critical a support system can be in persevering through challenges.

    My goal is to use the preventive approach of Positive Youth Development to work on the protective factors that help our children thrive.

        As we know in today’s world, there are many challenges and struggles.
        It is therefore very common for an adolescent to bump into some turbulence on the
        road to adulthood. When the turbulence is unaddressed, it can grow and lead to
        the development of unhealthy coping mechanisms. By focusing on developing and
        strengthening the 4 c’s one has a much better toolbox for life and building healthy
         coping mechanisms to face the challenges.
