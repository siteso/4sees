<h1>Foresee Positive Youth Development</h1>
  <p>
    Positive Youth Development is a focus on protective factors that have been proven to help children succeed
    in their journey from childhood to adulthood.
  <p>

  <p>
    As we know in today’s world, there are many challenges and struggles. It is therefore very common for an adolescent
    to bump into some turbulence on the road to adulthood.  When the turbulence is unaddressed, it can grow and lead to the
    development of unhealthy coping mechanisms.  By focusing on developing and strengthening the 4 c’s one has a much better
    toolbox for life and building healthy coping mechanisms to face the challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    In counseling your child, I strive to build a connection with her.  Through that connection I want to ensure that she will
    build other healthy connections with her family and friends. I want to empower her to recognize her strengths which will build her confidence and in turn her ability to communicate and her level  of competence. My role as an adolescent counselor is to be attuned to giving the adolescent all that she needs from me as well as noticing if there are factors that require people with other roles to step up or step into the picture. My role is to help her develop herself to become a contributing member of society.
  </p>
