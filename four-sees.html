<h1>Foresee Positive Youth Development</h1>
  <p>
    Positive Youth Development is a focus on protective factors that have been proven to help children succeed
    in their journey from childhood to adulthood.
  <p>

  <p>
    As we know in today’s world, there are many challenges and struggles. It is therefore very common for an adolescent
    to bump into some turbulence on the road to adulthood.  When the turbulence is unaddressed, it can grow and lead to the
    development of unhealthy coping mechanisms.  By focusing on developing and strengthening the 4 c’s one has a much better
    toolbox for life and building healthy coping mechanisms to face the challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    In counseling your child, I strive to build a connection with her.  Through that connection I want to ensure that she will
    build other healthy connections with her family and friends. I want to empower her to recognize her strengths which will build her confidence and in turn her ability to communicate and her level  of competence. My role as an adolescent counselor is to be attuned to giving the adolescent all that she needs from me as well as noticing if there are factors that require people with other roles to step up or step into the picture. My role is to help her develop herself to become a contributing member of society.

    Foresee Positive Youth Development focuses on the Four C's:

    <p>
    Hashem created us all with the need for connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we are blocked from the ability to connect, whether by internal or external obstacles, we feel a hole; we do not feel whole. Some people have a strong ability to connect with others easily, while others struggle to connect with anyone. Sometimes our natural tendencies are inhibited by trauma or other circumstances. This can result in our sabotaging ourselves from creating the connections that we crave in our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is crucial for our children’s development for them to feel and actually be connected to others. Connecting to parents, siblings and friends as well as values, communities, and teachers is an integral and even critical part of our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    There has been much research on the correlation between mental health and social connection. The American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine has this to say in their abstract on the topic:

  <p class="italics">
    Social connection is a pillar of lifestyle medicine. Humans are wired to connect, and this connection affects our health. From psychological theories to recent research, there is significant evidence that social support and feeling connected can help people maintain a healthy body mass index, control blood sugars, improve cancer survival, decrease cardiovascular mortality, decrease depressive symptoms, mitigate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and improve overall mental health. The opposite of connection, social isolation, has a negative effect on health and can increase depressive symptoms as well as mortality. Counseling patients on increasing social connections, prescribing connection, and inquiring about quantity and quality of social interactions at routine visits are ways that lifestyle medicine specialists can use connection to help patients to add not only years to their life but also health and well-being to those years.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is quite a laundry list of positive byproducts of improved social connections. We can look into our own lives and see the differences in our own well being during times where we were or felt isolated  in comparison to times where we felt supported and socially connected.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have had far too many people tell me how isolated they feel. This can be said by someone who is surrounded by people, yet feels alone. Real connection includes the ability to share and be vulnerable about our feelings and shortcomings with at least one other person. The lack of this connection can have devastating repercussions.

  <p>
    Assessment:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      WHAT is missing in your child’s connections?
    </li>

    <li>
    WHY is it missing?
  </li>

  <li>
    HOW can we resolve the missing connection or the root of that lacking piece?
  </li>

  <li>
    WHO should my child be connected to that is missing in his/her life?
  </li>

  <li>
    WHERE can my child find a way to develop this connection safely?
  </li>

  </ul>
