<p>
Foresee was created to help parents identify issues before they escalate into full blown problems. </p>


<p>
Parenting in this way requires a two-tier process. One step is about the child and the other is actually about the parent.  Parenting can take up a lot of our physical and emotional energies. There are tips and methods to make the physical part less stressful. What about the emotional aspect?
</p>

<p>
Did you ever drive a car that is running out of gas? It is very anxiety provoking and even dangerous. Well, parenting can be similar depending on what type of fuel we are putting into our “cars”.
</p>


<p>
If our parenting is driven by Guilt, Anger and Shame it is no wonder that we are emotionally drained! The way to work on these difficult feelings, which are often triggered by our efforts to be good parents, is to refill our tanks with different gas. Gratitude, Awareness and Support. The Foresee method is to work on replacing as much negative fuel with the positive reframing that can energize you and your parenting skills.
</p>

<p>
The process is a very functional one. It is not a quick fix nor a slow healing. It is about gaining awareness of yourselves as people and as parents and working with your individual strengths and weaknesses to be the best parent that you can be to each child that you were blessed to have.
</p>


<p>
The focus on your child will be easier to tackle once we are running on a full tank (or at least partially full)! We will look at the four C’s as they effect your child and your relationship with your child in a collaborative manner. This might include meetings with parent(s), your child or combined sessions. The approach is individual based on what your needs are. It is supportive counseling. It may include other resources based on needs that are known or discovered through the sessions.
