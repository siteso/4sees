  One of my favorite Aliya stories occurred over thirty years ago on a trip that my husband and I  took to the USA.  At the time, I was living in Yerushalayim and as we all did back then, I ordered a Nesher taxi service to take us to the airport.  Nesher drivers were notorious for their "patience" and sure enough, our driver was fuming about some pickup on his route where the couple were delayed.  The driver was VERY upset and then.the couple who looked to be in their eighties were gently and graciously seated into the van with help by ….none other than our Nesher driver!
</p>

<p>
  Fast forward to the end of our trip at the O'Hare airport.
</p>

<p>
  We are saying our goodbyes to our family, not knowing when we will meet again.
</p>

<p>
  An overly smiley airport clerk gently requested that we get moving. When we took a few more seconds to finish our hugs, Mrs. Smiley, through her gritted teeth made her request more forcefully.
</p>

<p>
  So as far as Sabras go, we have to remember that they are soft on the inside. But why do they have to sometimes be so prickly on the outside??
</p>

<p>
  As Americans and more so as American Jews we give a lot of value to the midda of being sensitive. Oftentimes we feel that this sensitivity may not be serving us or our children well, certainly  in the Israeli cultural climate but perhaps even in any climate! We watch our sensitive children  suffer from bullying, ,not having friends .or not getting onto a bus because they did not push to get on. Being sensitive is a sensitive issue indeed!
</p>

<p>
  Is there a way to infuse and encourage our children to be sensitive while making sure they are not suffering for it?
</p>

<p>
   I decided to get started on tackling this question. I would google a definition for "sensitive". What I found was quite telling and actually begins to bring us closer to an answer.
</p>

<p>
  The Cambridge dictionary had a number of definitions listed. Two of them went as follows:<br />
  1)having or showing awareness and understanding, esp. of other people’s feelings and needs:<br />
  2)easily upset by the things people say or do, or causing people to be upset, embarrassed, or angry:
</p>

<p>
   Two seemingly conflicting definitions. This is exactly the issue!
</p>

<p>
  Some of us are born with a stronger propensity towards being sensitive and some with less.  Obviously we try to give our children the chinuch that being sensitive is good by encouraging them to be sensitive to the needs of others through our own modelling and other chinuch methods.  The issue lies where a child feels hurt or vulnerable due to his sensitivity. Sometimes the child cannot function in his school because he cannot bear the insensitive actions of other students or even teachers. How do we deal with that ramification of sensitivity?
</p>

<p>
  I think we need to start with awareness. A child should be  made aware of the fact that he is sensitive and given the understanding that this is a gift that Hashem gave to him It allows him to perform many mitzvot in a way that others without this midda might not be able to do or to do as well as he can.  That being said , the child should also be made aware that this gift comes with some challenges which includes a heightened vulnerability to be hurt by others or even by his own perceptions. The child needs to be given tools to protect himself from being vulnerable to the point that he is no longer safe in his environment. Of course the discussion and tools have to be age appropriate to be effective.
</p>

<p>
  Let me give you a personal example: One of my sons has a tendency towards being shy. (Not the ones you know, obviously!). Now being shy is actually a great midda. It is listed as one of the ways that you can be identified as a descendant of Avraham Avinu. BUT if that shyness is negatively affecting your ability to make friends then if it is important to you to make friends you have to leave your comfort zone and be "less shy".  I told my son what a great midda he has and that he can be really proud of the midda. I then added that I was impressed that he was making the effort to be more "out there" so he could make the friends that he wanted. I was shocked at how grateful my son was for first appreciating his good midda and only then noticing his efforts. (And he was an adolescent at the time!!).
</p>

<p>
  How can we use this model for a sensitive child? We can point out how proud we are when he thinks or gives to siblings or friends in a healthy way. AND we can listen and notice when there might be an unhealthy exchange, when our child feels hurt or feels he is obligated to give something that he does not want to give. We can then discuss the situation. Is it the child's perception that is creating a problem? This is often the case with a sensitive child. It is very important to give the child a glimpse into how others might think and act so that he can learn to realize that this is not really about him. If the situation is objectively a problem, then he might need to react differently or distance himself to be safe.
</p>

<p>
  Looking at both sides of the sensitive coin is essential for maintaining the positive parts of being sensitive. When we don't do that and are hurt by being sensitive we may develop some prickly skin to protect ourselves. The problem is that prickly skin can prickle others too! It can even develop into other coping methods which are very harmful to ourselves and others.  The key is to be sensitive to others while being aware of our own feelings and protecting ourselves when necessary.
</p>

<p>
  So as for Sabras, you have to know how to peel them i.e. perceive them. They are not all so prickly!
</p>

<p>
   If you do have to deal with a particularly prickly one, please use the advice above for guidance.
