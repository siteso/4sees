    <h4>Social Connection</h4>

</div>

<div class="content">
  <p>
  Hashem created us all with the need for connection.
</p>

<p>
  When we are blocked from the ability to connect, whether by internal or external obstacles, we feel a hole; we do not feel whole. Some people have a strong ability to connect with others easily, while others struggle to connect with anyone. Sometimes our natural tendencies are inhibited by trauma or other circumstances. This can result in our sabotaging ourselves from creating the connections that we crave in our lives.
</p>

<p>
  It is crucial for our children’s development for them to feel and actually be connected to others. Connecting to parents, siblings and friends as well as values, communities, and teachers is an integral and even critical part of our lives.
</p>

<p>
  There has been much research on the correlation between mental health and social connection. The American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine has this to say in their abstract on the topic:

<p class="italics">
  Social connection is a pillar of lifestyle medicine. Humans are wired to connect, and this connection affects our health. From psychological theories to recent research, there is significant evidence that social support and feeling connected can help people maintain a healthy body mass index, control blood sugars, improve cancer survival, decrease cardiovascular mortality, decrease depressive symptoms, mitigate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and improve overall mental health. The opposite of connection, social isolation, has a negative effect on health and can increase depressive symptoms as well as mortality. Counseling patients on increasing social connections, prescribing connection, and inquiring about quantity and quality of social interactions at routine visits are ways that lifestyle medicine specialists can use connection to help patients to add not only years to their life but also health and well-being to those years.
</p>

<p>
  This is quite a laundry list of positive byproducts of improved social connections. We can look into our own lives and see the differences in our own well being during times where we were or felt isolated  in comparison to times where we felt supported and socially connected.
</p>

<p>
  I have had far too many people tell me how isolated they feel. This can be said by someone who is surrounded by people, yet feels alone. Real connection includes the ability to share and be vulnerable about our feelings and shortcomings with at least one other person. The lack of this connection can have devastating repercussions.
</p>

<p>
  Assessment:
</p>  
<ul>
  <li>
    WHAT is missing in your child’s connections?
  </li>

  <li>
  WHY is it missing?
</li>

<li>
  HOW can we resolve the missing connection or the root of that lacking piece?
</li>

<li>
  WHO should my child be connected to that is missing in his/her life?
</li>

<li>
  WHERE can my child find a way to develop this connection safely?
</li>

</ul>
